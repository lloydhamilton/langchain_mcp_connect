# Langchain Model Context Protocol Connector

## Introduction
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard released by Anthropic. 
The Model Context Protocol highlights the importance of tooling standardisation through open protocols. 
Specifically, it standardises how applications interact and provide context to LLMs. 
Just like how HTTP standardises how we communicate across the internet, MCP provides a standard protocol for LLM to interact with external tools. 
You can find out more about the MCP at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol and https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction

This project introduces tools to easily integrate MCP with langchain.
